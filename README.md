- R: 3 years of experience
- SQL/NoSQL: 3 years of experience
- PySpark: 2 years of experience
- SAS: 2 years of experience
- PySpark: 2 years of experience
- EDA and Machine learning: 3 years of experience
- PowerBI: 2 years of experience
- Javascript/NodeJS (backend): 2 years of experience
- ReactJS: 1 year of experience
- FastApi: 1 year of experience
