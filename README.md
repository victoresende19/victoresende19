## Hi there ✌
I'm a 22-year-old student from Brazil that loves to solve data problems! Currently, I'm studying Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. At the period of 2021 until now, I'm working with Full Stack Development and Data Science at [IBM-Brazil](https://www.ibm.com/br-pt). I love ducks!  

## Skills
I'm focusing to improve my machine learning and deep learning skills even more. Also, learning FastAPI to deploy models in endpoints:
- Python (Pandas, Matploblib, Numpy, and others): 4 years of experience
- R: 3 years of experience
- SQL/NoSQL: 3 years of experience
- SAS: 2 years of experience
- PySpark: 2 years of experience
- EDA and Machine learning: 3 years of experience
- PowerBI: 2 years of experience
- Javascript/NodeJS (backend): 2 years of experience


## Most used languages
As a goal to be a data scientist, I tend to program in languages that'll be helpful to solve statistics and business problems easier.
