## Hi there âœŒ
I'm 22 years old student from Brazil that's love to solve data problems! Currently, I'm studying Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. At the period of 2021 until now, I'm working with Full Stack Development and Data Science at [IBM-Brazil](https://www.ibm.com/br-pt). I love ducks!

## Most used languages
As a goal to be a data scientist, I tend to program in languages that'll be helpful to solve statistics and business problems easier.

## Goals
- 2020: Learn Python libraries to deploy a machine learning solution using streamlit, pandas, numpy, scikit learn and sqlalchemy. âœ…
- 2021: Learn R libraries as dplyr, tidyr, caret and stringr to improve my skills in my internship at [INEP](https://www.gov.br/inep/pt-br). âœ…
- 2022: Improve my clean code and learn more about good practices for programming. Also, learn some developer skills like back-end (NodeJS, Nest), front-end (React), and NoSQL like MongoDB. âœ…
- 2023: Improve my statistic skills for machine learning techniques, big data processing with Spark (PySpark, SparkR), and get deeply on Cloud.
